 Flowflix DMCA

Flowflix, including its mobile application and website, operates in full compliance with all applicable copyright laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Flowflix provides a platform that enables the use of third-party extensions developed independently by external developers. These third-party extensions are offered “as-is” and Flowflix has no control over their code, functionality, or content.

Flowflix does not endorse, modify, or create the content provided by these third-party extensions, and any copyright infringement claims related to their content are outside of Flowflix’s control. Users are responsible for their own compliance with copyright laws and for reporting any alleged infringements through the appropriate channels, such as the hosting platform (e.g., GitHub) where the extensions reside.

Flowflix is committed to cooperating in good faith with copyright holders and will respond to legitimate concerns within the scope of its platform. However, Flowflix cannot be held liable for any alleged copyright infringement arising from the use of third-party extensions. The platform merely facilitates access to independent extensions and does not assume responsibility for their content or legality.

By using Flowflix, users acknowledge that third-party extensions are developed independently, and any issues concerning copyright violations should be addressed directly to the respective developers or hosting platforms. Flowflix remains dedicated to lawful operation, responsible platform management, and cooperation with copyright holders where feasible.
